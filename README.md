# layout-and-positioning
following the odin project while coding for JTC's onRamp


to do when github is online


- load html with boilerplate
- create 3 separate divs
- each will be used; one for display, flex and position
- create borders around each box, so that the border wraps around the content and doesnt stretch along the entire screen.
- play around with how to center.
- done <3
